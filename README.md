# ðŸ“š Supervised-Learning-Techniques

This repository contains the Phase 1 implementation for the CS235 course project at UCR. It includes a comprehensive pipeline for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation using Python's powerful data science and machine learning libraries. Key components include:

- **Data Analysis:** Exploration and preparation using libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
- **Visualization:** Data visualization with Matplotlib to gain insights and showcase results.
- **Machine Learning:** Implementation of preprocessing workflows (`Pipeline`, `ColumnTransformer`), missing data handling (`SimpleImputer`), encoding (`OneHotEncoder`), and scaling (`StandardScaler`).
- **Gradient Boosting Models:** GradientBoostingRegressor, CatBoostRegressor, and XGBRegressor for advanced regression tasks.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance assessment using metrics like Mean Squared Error and cross-validation techniques (`cross_val_score`).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Grid search (`GridSearchCV`) for optimal model performance.

This code serves as a foundation for end-to-end machine learning workflows, supporting efficient data processing, robust modeling, and comprehensive evaluation techniques.
